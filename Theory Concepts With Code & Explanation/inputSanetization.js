// ** input sanetization 

// Input sanitization is a security practice used to clean and validate user inputs before processing them in a web application. It aims to prevent various attacks, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and other injection-based vulnerabilities.

// The process of input sanitization involves removing or neutralizing potentially dangerous characters or scripts from user inputs. By doing so, developers ensure that the data used in the application is safe and does not pose a threat to the system.

// Here are some common techniques used in input sanitization:

// Whitelist Validation: Define a whitelist of acceptable characters, and reject any input that contains characters outside this whitelist. This approach allows only known safe characters to be processed.

// Blacklist Validation: Identify a blacklist of known dangerous characters or scripts and reject any input that contains them. However, this approach is less secure than whitelisting since attackers can bypass blacklists by using alternate representations of dangerous characters.

// Escape Characters: Instead of removing certain characters, you can escape them by adding backslashes or using other escape sequences. This approach ensures that potentially dangerous characters are treated as plain text and not interpreted as code.

// Regular Expressions: Use regular expressions to validate and sanitize user inputs. This allows you to define specific patterns that the input must match, allowing only valid and safe data to be accepted.

// Parameterized Queries: When dealing with databases, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. These techniques separate the SQL code from user inputs, making it difficult for attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.

// HTML Encoding: When displaying user-generated content on web pages, use HTML encoding to convert special characters into their HTML entity equivalents. This prevents HTML tags or scripts from being executed as code.
